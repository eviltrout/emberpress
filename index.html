        <h2>How to Play</h2>

        <p>Players take turns forming words from the tiles. Click on a letter
           tile to add it to your word. When your word is complete, hit <b>Submit</b>.
           You will then convert those letter tiles to your player's color.</p>

        <p>There is no Internet multiplayer component - both players must take turns on the 
           same computer.</p>

        <p>Scores are calculated based on how many colored tiles you are assuming.
           If you convert the opposing player's tile to your color, it will be
           subtracted from their score.</p>

        <p>The game ends either when every tile on the board has a color, or
           when both players pass their turn in a row.</p>

        <h2>Fortifying Tiles</h2>

        <p>If you color a tile and all of its surrounding tiles (NESW, like a compass)
           it will be fortified and become darker. The opposing player may not steal 
           that tile and take a point from you. However, if they steal back a surrounding
           tile, it will become unfortified and return to play.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Words must be at least two letters long.</li>
        <li>Words may not be played more than once.</li>
        <li>You can't play a word that was the beginning of a previously played word. For
            example if the word "ABSOLUTE" was played, you may not play "ABS." You can
            add on additional letters though: "ABSOLUTELY" would be fine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who made this?</h2>

        <p>This is a clone of the popular <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8" target="_blank">Letterpress</a>
           game. It is meant to show off the client side powers of the <a href="http://emberjs.org" target="_blank">EmberJS</a> 
           framework and was originally created for <a href="http://torontoemberjs.com/" target="_blank">Toronto EmberJS</a> 
           meetup by <a href="http://eviltrout.com/" target="_blank">Evil Trout</a>.</p>

        <p>Mucho thanks go out Loren Brichter for the inspiration. Thanks to the EmberJS 
           team for making an awesome framework that makes client side development fun. 
           The dictionary was imported from <a href="http://dreamsteep.com/projects/the-english-open-word-list.html">EOWL</a>.
           The player icons are from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>.
